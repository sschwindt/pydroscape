# Introduction
This repository provides Python3 scripts for many sorts of river-related analyses, including tools for plotting data and processing data.

Installed as local package, the functionalities can be accessed in Python with `pydroscape.FUNCTION`, where the following functions are available:

* blue_plot: x-y, 2D (heatmap), and 3D plots with numpy and matplotlib.
* data_proc: Process experimental data recorded with any kind of data logger.

# Requirements
 * Python 3.x (that should be clear)
 * Basic packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`
 * Supplemental packages (required by some functions only): `pandas`, `qgis.core`, `gdal`, `osgeo`
 
Pydroscapes exclusively uses open source packages and software that is free of charge (among others: QGIS).
